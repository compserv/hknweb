hknweb
======

Welcome! This is the in-progress redesign for the HKN (Mu Chapter) website,
built with Django.

## Setup (Quick)

This approach is simpler if you are new to developing software.

**Vagrant** will automatically setup a virtual machine with the correct
setup for developing `hknweb`.

Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/),
then run:

```sh
$ vagrant up
```

which will download and boot a Linux virtual machine, then run setup.

To access the environment, run

```sh
$ vagrant ssh
```

which will `ssh` your terminal into the virtual machine.

See [Development](#development) for how to run the Django web server.

To turn off the virtual machine, run

```sh
$ vagrant halt
```

which will attempt to safely shutdown the virtual machine, or kill it otherwise.

## Setup (Manual)

This approach requires less space, and is faster if your computer already has Python
and GNU Make installed (i.e. most GNU/Linux machines.)

Developming `hknweb` requires [`pipenv`](https://docs.pipenv.org), which will
manage the Python virtualenv, selecting the correct Python version, and
installing all dependencies.

On systems with sudo (root) privileges, you can run

```sh
$ pip install pipenv
```

For systems without sudo privileges, the following will work:

```sh
$ make setup
```

which will also install the Python dev environment (Python dependencies, a virtualenv).
Without sudo privileges, you will need to add the binary location to your `PATH` variable.
On Linux, this is `~/.local/bin`, and on Windows, this is `AppData\Roaming\Python\bin`.

```sh
$ echo "export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" >> .bashrc
```

Django will also require a working copy of MySQL (or MariaDB).

## Development

To run the Django development server (which runs a web server locally), run
```sh
$ make
```

In a Vagrant box, run
```sh
$ cd ~/hknweb
$ make
```

which will make the web site available at `http://localhost:3000`.

If you would like to access the admin interface in the local web server, run
```sh
$ make createsuperuser
```

You will be prompted for some login info, after which you should be able to access
the admin interface with your super user credentials at `http://localhost:3000/admin`.
