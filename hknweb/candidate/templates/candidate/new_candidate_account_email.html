        Hi {{ first_name }}!
    </p>

    <p>
        I've created an account for you <a href="{{ website_link }}">here</a>!<br>
        <br>
        Here are your account details, as well as a temporarily generated password:<br>
        Username: {{ username }}<br>
        Password: {{ password }}<br>
        <br>
        You can change your password upon logging in, which you should do so promptly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you've logged in, feel free to explore our website. 
        The candidate portal is accessed by clicking "Welcome, {{ first_name }}" in the top right corner, 
        then clicking "Candidate Portal". 
        This is where you can view your progress for your candidate requirements!

        Information about our events can be found in three different places:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your candidate portal will show a list of a few upcoming events.
            </li>
            <li>
                "Events" --> "Calendar" leads to a calendar view. 
                Click on an event in the calendar to view the event's details.
            </li>
            <li>
