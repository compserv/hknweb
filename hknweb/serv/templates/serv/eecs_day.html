        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Taking place every Fall, EECS Day is our annual open house, providing prospective students in high-school and their parents with an opportunity to learn firsthand
            what it is like to study <a href="http://eecs.berkeley.edu">EECS at UC Berkeley</a>. The dayâ€™s activities typically include a department tour, various hands-on EECS workshops and demos, and the chance to speak to
            UC Berkeley professors and students on their personal experiences. For those not yet in high school but are still eager to learn about EECS at Cal, HKN hosts <a href="jreecs">Junior EECS Day</a>.</p>
