        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><a href="http://calday.berkeley.edu/">Cal Day</a> is UC Berkeleyâ€™s free annual public open house, and HKN will be holding drop-in introductory EECS workshops for campus visitors.
             In past years, our hands-on workshop projects have included creating a programmable LED array that could flash in different patterns
              using a MSP430 microcontroller, or a blinking LED controlled by a 555 timer IC chip.</p>
        <p><i>Annual, Spring Semester</i></p>
        <p><b>Unfortunately, Cal Day has been cancelled this semester as part of campus policies regarding COVID-19.</b></p>
