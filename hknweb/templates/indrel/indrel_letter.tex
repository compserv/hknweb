UC Berkeley is the home of the Mu chapter of Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), the international honor society for
electrical engineers and computer scientists. The Mu chapter of HKN consists of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science (EECS) students who are in the top 25\% of their junior class or the top 33\% of their senior
class. Beyond their impressive academic achievements, HKN members are the most qualified candidates for
engineering jobs due to their extensive extracurricular activities, philanthropic endeavors, and social
involvement in the campus community. Most of our members also have research and work experience in their
fields of study, complementing their academic excellence with real-world experience.

The EECS major combines the disciplines of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science into one
comprehensive curriculum that prepares students for a wide variety of both technical and non-technical jobs.
Students may study a wide variety of topics ranging from circuits and electronics to software and computation
theory. But regardless of the specific course of study taken, students in the EECS major have the ability to
identify, formulate, and solve challenging engineering problems because of the strong foundation in
fundamental mathematics, science, and engineering that is gained in the EECS major. Furthermore, the EECS
major allows students to foster their professional maturity and gain the knowledge and skills needed to
become effective communicators, leaders, citizens, and engineers.

HKN offers a variety of services to the students and staff at Berkeley, including peer advising, free daily
tutoring to students, an archive of past examination files, and conducts semesterly evaluations of classes and
professors. HKN also helps with many community service events, volunteering for Habitat for Humanity,
Friends of Five Creeks, Rebuilding Together, and other charitable organizations. HKN thanks you for your
support, which allows us to continue to provide these services to the students and staff of the university as
well as the surrounding community.

Please visit our website at \url{https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/indrel/} for more information about what HKN can do for
your company. In addition to resume books, HKN can also schedule tech talks and corporate information
sessions for your company. If you have any questions regarding the resume book and Eta Kappa Nu in
general, please email us at \url{indrel@hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu}.
