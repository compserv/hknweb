        <p class='what-about-subtitle'>Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) is the <a href='https://hkn.ieee.org/' target='_blank'>national Electrical and Computer Engineering honor society</a>. Founded in 1915, the Mu chapter at UC Berkeley is among the most active engineering societies at Berkeley. We strive to serve the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) community at Berkeley by providing weekly tutoring hours, exam review sessions, department tours, course and staff evaluations, among many other services. Our two offices are located in 290 Cory and 345 Soda near the <a href='https://berkeley.edu/map' target='_blank'>northeastern corner of the UC Berkeley campus</a>.</p>

        <h2>Industrial Relations</h2>
        <p>HKN has strong ties with industry, linking students with companies by setting up info sessions where companies can give a presentation about themselves and provide a forum for students to talk to industry and find out more about the work environment. Additionally, we sell resume books containing the resumes of our members.</p>
